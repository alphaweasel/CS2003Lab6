	Overall, Umple vastly increases the simplicity of the program.  Whereas java code might have get and set methods
for every variable in a class, Umple allows for the core components of the class to be displayed without the need for
large amounts of text, as the methods are all generated later.  The simplicity of the UML allows for the basic concepts to be understood
without most of the details, allowing for it to convey ideas to those with little to no programming ability.
	While Umple's generated code contains much more code than my own classes, much of of the code contains unnecessary lines of code.
The generated code, while made quickly with the press of a button, ultimately is not the perfect translation of the UML into code.  While
Umple provides a great base from which the rest of the program can be created, Umple only can create basic, unfinished code.
	In the future, Umple and UML will be extremely helpful during the beginning stages of my projects, as I will be able to better plan out
my code.  With the correct basic structure, the rest of the code will be much easier to write and will be built with a sturdy foundation.
